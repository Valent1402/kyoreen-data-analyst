                <p>
                    This project analyses player- and tournament-level performance (damage, kills, survival, movement, reaction and decision timing). The goal is to identify strengths, weaknesses and training priorities for players.

                <h3>How the data was collected</h3>
                <p>
                    I reviewed match recordings and timed player actions on my phone. "MovementTime" captures minutes of active movement (engaging or roaming). "ReactionTime" and "DecisionTime" are measured in seconds for combat reactions and tactical choices. These manual
                    measures were aggregated to per-player averages for the analyses.

                <h3>Conclusions & Recommendations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Average_Kill and Average_Damage strongly correlate with the "WillImprove" indicator — offensive output is a key improvement signal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MovementTime shows a weak negative correlation with improvement in this dataset — consider focused training on purposeful movement and positioning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ReactionTime is moderately negatively correlated with improvement — reaction and aiming drills could benefit certain players.
                    </li>
                </ul>
